R2WARS BOTS

My r2wars[0] bot attempts, for r2con2020[1].  jump.x86-32.asm was the
final submission.  Look at its history for how it evolved across day 1,
2, 3 and 4 of the conference.

Debug using:

   $ radare2 -c "e asm.arch=x86;
     e asm.bits=32;
     aei;
     aeim;
     wx "$(rasm2 -a x86 -b 32 -f $BOT.x86-32.asm)" @ 100;
     aer PC=100;
     aer SP=SP+100;
     Vpp" malloc://1024
